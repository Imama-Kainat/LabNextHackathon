# ChatCinema: A Conversational Movie Recommendation System

**ChatCinema** is an interactive movie recommendation system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user input. Built using Streamlit, ChatCinema leverages Groq, a vector database, to store and retrieve movie embeddings, offering a seamless and engaging user experience.
